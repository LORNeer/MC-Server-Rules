# Minecraft Server Rules/Information
This minecraft server runs on version 1.18 and survival. The difficulty is normal.
Access to this server is limited (whitelist). The seed will **not** be revealed.  
Breaking the following rules will be punished. The severity of the punishment depends on the severity of your action.
The admins (see list below) have the final say in the punishment. 
If you have suggestions or complaints, feel free to contact one of the admins.

Admins:  
* Hulka (DC: Bigboy#6823, MC: )
* Kalchi (DC: Thinker#0001, MC: TheKalchi)
* Markus (DC: Laffey#3549, MC: Makmex)

The admins reserve the rights to change or adapt these rules at all time.

## 1. Basic Rules
### 1.1 Basic Principles
1.1.1 Have common sense  
1.1.2 Treat others with respect  
1.1.3 No Cheating  
1.1.4 No Griefing  
1.1.5 No Spamming  
1.1.6 **One** account per Player  
1.1.7 Mild trolling is welcome

### 1.2 Behavior in the World
1.2.1 Building private buildings on the world spawn (300 block radius) is not allowed.
The world spawn will be used for community/shared buildings.  
1.2.2 Players that are not interested in working/playing together
should build their homes with reasonable distance from one another  
1.2.3 Trees do not need to be replanted, but trees have to be completely mined  
1.2.4 Creeper holes have to be filled  
1.2.5 Farms that obviously belong to a player need to be replanted  
1.2.6 Pets that obviously belong to a player are not to be killed  
1.2.7 Hostile mobs that were summoned/brought by a player are to be killed by that player as fast as possible.
Any damage done by those mobs to other players belongings need to be fixed by the player that summoned them.

### 1.3 Farm Rules
1.3.1 All farms are allowed, as long as they are not forbidden by the following rules  
1.3.2 Farms that lead to severe lags or destroy the playing experience of other players are forbidden  
1.3.3 Farms that need a lot of performance and/or are used for special items should
(if possible) be built for/with the community  
1.3.4 AFK Farms are allowed, as long as rules 1.1.6 and 1.3.1 are not broken

### 1.4 The End
The first time entering the End and the first fight against the Ender Dragon is going to be a planned community event.
This will most likely happen within the first week of server launch (minimum wait time 3 days after launch) at a time
where most players (that want to participate) have time (most likely the weekend). The date will be set as a discord
event in the discord channel a few days before. Finding the stronghold and filling the portal is of course
allowed beforehand.

1.4.1 Entering the end and defeating the ender dragon for the first time before the community event is not allowed  
1.4.2 Respawning the ender dragon *after* buildings were built on the main island is not allowed,
as to not destroy those buildings. The dragon should be defeated a few times before starting to build, so that all the
end gateways appear  
1.4.3 The dragon egg is to be seen as a **community item** and shall not be taken without properly consulting the other
players

### 1.5 Building Rules
1.5.1 All buildings should either serve the purpose of beautifying the landscape or some important functionality  
1.5.2 There is now maximum build height or a limitation to the size of a building as long as rule 1.5.1 is not broken  
1.5.3 Unfinished buildings that have not been continued for a while (and are ugly) will be removed after a warning

## 2. PVP
2.1 PVP is allowed as long as it doesnt break any of the following rules  
2.2 Do not kill people without reason (stealing their resources after they were mining is **not** a reason)  
2.3 Do not kill players that are afk-farming  
2.3 Rules of war (see rule section 3) may modify these rules in any way

## 3. Village/Faction "RP"
There will be a very basic RP system. The purpose of this is making the server a bit more interesting.
You will have the possibility of creating teams via the Minecraft teams feature.

3.1 Everyone can create Teams and everyone can join teams out of their free will.
Teams can then use the ``/teammsg`` command to chat within the team.
For further infos on how to create and join teams please look at the information below.  
3.2 Teams with more than 5 members (or teams approved by the council) can send a representative to the "council"
(who this representative is has to be reported to the admins beforehand)  
3.3 The council is used to solve issues that may arise in the world (that do not need the attention of the admins)
3.4 Conflict between teams should preferably solved by the teams  
3.5 Teams can start wars between each other, the rules of war will be set by the team (almost everything is possible,
you can modify the rules of war **between** the factions that fight however you want).
Please inform the admins of ongoing wars and rule changes in those wars.  
3.6 Other teams may join the war *if* a team currently in the war wants them to. The admins also have to be
informed of this.  
3.7 Uninvolved factions **are not** to be harmed in any way

To create a team you need the following things:
* at least two members in total
* a *unique* team name (this is not the name that is shown in chat)
* the team name you want to show in chat
* the team prefix (if needed)
* the color you want the prefix to have 
* a designated leader of the team (this person can contact the admins to add new members). This leader may
  change at any point if so decided by the team
* other people who can add new members (if needed)

## 4. Discord
The Discord server will be used to communicate important information.

Important administrative information and the rules will be posted in #minecraft-server-118.  
Information about current factions and ongoing wars can be found in #minecraft-teams.  
The main chat about the server will be #minecraft-chat.  
Public coordinates for farms/villages/etc. can be shared in #minecraft-coordinates.
The #minecraft-srv-chat channel is a channel used to chat with people on the minecraft server. Every
message in minecraft is logged there and every message from discord is sent in the minecraft chat.
