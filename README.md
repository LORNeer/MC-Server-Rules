## 1. Basic Rules
### 1.1 Basic Principles
1.1.1 Have common sense  
1.1.2 Treat others with respect  
1.1.3 No Cheating  
1.1.4 No Griefing  
1.1.5 No Spamming  
1.1.6 **One** account per Player  
1.1.7 Mild trolling is welcome

### 1.2 Behavior in the World
1.2.1 Building private buildings on the world spawn (300 block radius) is not allowed.
The world spawn will be used for community/shared buildings.  
1.2.2 Players that are not interested in working/playing together
should build their homes with reasonable distance from one another  
1.2.3 Trees do not need to be replanted, but trees have to be completely mined  
1.2.4 Creeper holes have to be filled  
1.2.5 Farms that obviously belong to a player need to be replanted  
1.2.6 Pets that obviously belong to a player are not to be killed  
1.2.7 Hostile mobs that were summoned/brought by a player are to be killed by that player as fast as possible.
Any damage done by those mobs to other players belongings need to be fixed by the player that summoned them.

### 1.3 Farm Rules
1.3.1 All farms are allowed, as long as they are not forbidden by the following rules  
1.3.2 Farms that lead to severe lags or destroy the playing experience of other players are forbidden  
1.3.3 Farms that need a lot of performance and/or are used for special items should
(if possible) be built for/with the community  
1.3.4 AFK Farms are allowed, as long as rules 1.1.6 and 1.3.1 are not broken

### 1.4 The End
The first time entering the End and the first fight against the Ender Dragon is going to be a planned community event.
This will most likely happen within the first week of server launch (minimum wait time 3 days after launch) at a time
where most players (that want to participate) have time (most likely the weekend). The date will be set as a discord
event in the discord channel a few days before. Finding the stronghold and filling the portal is of course
allowed beforehand.

1.4.1 Entering the end and defeating the ender dragon for the first time before the community event is not allowed  
1.4.2 Respawning the ender dragon *after* buildings were built on the main island is not allowed,
as to not destroy those buildings. The dragon should be defeated a few times before starting to build, so that all the
end gateways appear  
1.4.3 The dragon egg is to be seen as a **community item** and shall not be taken without properly consulting the other
players

### 1.5 Building Rules
1.5.1 All buildings should either serve the purpose of beautifying the landscape or some important functionality  
1.5.2 There is now maximum build height or a limitation to the size of a building as long as rule 1.5.1 is not broken  
1.5.3 Unfinished buildings that have not been continued for a while (and are ugly) will be removed after a warning
